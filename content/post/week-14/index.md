## Assignments

This week you will explore a digital manufacturing technology beyond the capability of a basic fab lab.

Design and produce something with a digital process (incorporating computer-aided design and manufacturing) not covered in another assignment, documenting the requirements that your assignment meets, and including everything necessary to reproduce it.

- Choose one of the proposed digital manufacturing technologies.
- Create a digital design to be manufactured with the technology/machine of your choice.
- Work together with the workshop master and document the process.
- Publish the documentation on your course documentation page.
- Submit a link to your documentation page here.

plunge rate = 1/5 cutting rate (conservatively)



Vacuum forming difficulties: 

The covering tape would not come off fully - put it in there anyway

The acrylic would get pulled out from underneath the frame so that the vacuum breaks and it forms into a dent instead of the shape



Toolpaths for stand as well
