## 3-axis milling

plunge rate = 1/5 cutting rate (conservatively)



Vacuum forming difficulties: 

The covering tape would not come off fully - put it in there anyway

The acrylic would get pulled out from underneath the frame so that the vacuum breaks and it forms into a dent instead of the shape



Toolpaths for stand as well
