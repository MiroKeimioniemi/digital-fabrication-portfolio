Here begins the documentation of my digital fabrication journey. It is produced in accordance to the
specifications and pace of the AXM-E7009 - Digital Fabrication I course at [Aalto University](https://aalto.my.site.com/courses/s/course/a057T0000043wLhQAI/digital-fabrication-i?language=en_US) / Aalto
Fablab that is an overlay for the worldwide [Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org/), therefore following their curriculum and
schedule - only it is cheaper, but does not provide the Fab Academy certificate. Why I point this out,
however, is that there may also be other slight differences such as the actual start date of the course,
which, for us, was two weeks before the first global lecture, allowing for a very gentle start. The
explanation for why this covers weeks 1 - 3 instead of only the first one is that I am numbering them
according to the overlay course instead of the Fab Academy curriculum, although the topics are in the
same order.

## Assignments

## Setting up

To immediately get many of us out of comfort zones, we were instructed to set up our repositories on
GitLab instead of GitHub, which was fine by me, having routinely used both. What was new to me,
however, was using the non-organization-hosted [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), for which I had to make
an account separately.
