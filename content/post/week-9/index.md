Speaker can be integrated very directly by just using an amp with breakout board according to this example: https://github.com/kr15h/i2s_xiao-esp32c3

Create a XIAO breakout board with a I2C connection to communicate with another board, an integrated speaker connection and connectors for LEDs

Capacitors, diode, voltage regulator,

push the flux pen

Resistor markings: 4990 means 499 and 0 zeros

Struggled even more here than last week with my arch nemesis: NeoPixel LED strips

104 capacitor refers to 0.1uF
