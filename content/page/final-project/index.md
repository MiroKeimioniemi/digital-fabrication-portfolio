The LED Zeppelin is a custom gesture controlled sunrise alarm clock lamp, where all the electronics are contained within the ellipsoid diffuser, that can be placed on or inside various different kinds of separate stands. It works as a regular lamp by tapping it to turn it on or off and swiping towards either end to adjust its brightness either up or down. The alarm clock functionality works via a mobile app where you can choose an animation including a sound that will start and reach its peak at the times set. The app can also be used to change the color as well as fine tune the brightness.

**Notes:**

<ol>
  <li value="5">Output circuit must be redesigned using level shifters in order to use 5V power for NeoPixels with 3.3V logic. 3.5mm audio socket pins must also be routed correctly. NeoPixels and level shifters are both already procured and available at the FabLab. </li>
  <br>
  <li value="6">Light animations can be programmed among the last tasks when the lamp is already assembled so that they look as intended.</li>
  <br>
  <li value="9">Likely need to purchase a 5V power source capable of 9A as I could not find one at the lab. ESP32C3 can be powere on from its 5V pin with a diode but SAMD21 must be considered separately.</li>
  <br>
  <li value="15">3/4D mill a sikablock to produce half an ellipsoid diffuser by vacuum forming 3mm translucent (or white) acrylic already available at the lab. 
  
  Using Roland Modela MDX-40 might require a more elaborate design, where the piece to be vacuum formed might have to be produced in several layers. It, however, might not have sufficient length dimension either so 3D-axis milling with the larger CNC might be the best idea. It is a good idea to account for the fillet at the base of the mold by making it a bit higher than what the vacuum formed product should be. Remember to measure the height possible for a 3D-milled ellipsoid.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li value="14">Design a separate 3D-printable framework that safely suspends the circuit in the middle of the lamp from supports whose lengths correspond to the exact radius of the ellipsoid at the given positions. The circuit board can be fastened to it with screws and it can be fastened to the lamp cover with some kind of adhesive. With good design and little transportation, it might not have to be fastened at all. It is also obviously highly important to leave a hole for the power cable.</li>
  <br>
  <li value="16">Flexible copper strips soldered to jumper cables can be attached to the underside of the diffuser from their adhesive sides as seven looped stripes around the long axis. The internal frame can be fastened to one half with a strong adhesive and to the other with a slow one upon closing the ellipsoid. Alternatively, it does not have to be fastened to the other side at all. In this case, I could make the cover openable with some sort of a snapping mechanism, which is likely much harder to make but would make the lamp easily repairable.</li>
  <br>
  <li value="17">3D mill a wood block.</li>
  <br>
  <li value="20">Make it behave like a luminous pet or a spren (from The Stormlight Archive) that turns on dimly when detecting proximity and might occasionally want attention, which it communicates by changing its hue until acknowledged with, for example, a long touch to which it might respond with some different light pattern. It could be made to track, for example, a habit or whether one had a good day. It could also be linked with another similar lamp such that if it is being touched for long, the other lamp lights up the area that is being touched and one can thus, for example, say a personal good night with it. In the long run it could even be made to talk and listen with additional hardware capabilities but those are definitely beyonf the current scope.</li>

## Ideation

Having to come up with a final project idea as pretty much the first thing without knowing how everything works caught me a bit off guard but it does make sense in the context of the course as it is so intense, fast-paced and packed with both information and assignments. Having a final project thought out in the very beginning helps you orient your approach to each week and know what you most need to focus on. For example, as a result of the below brainstorming and committing to an idea, I knew that I needed to focus especially on LEDs and speakers on the [output week]({{< relref "post/week-9/index.md" >}}). It was a long road to arrive at the idea, however, and what follows is a dump of some of the ideas I got, considered and eventually discarded.

The ideation phase is often very long for me as I always want to create something somehow meaningful, whether that is in a local or global context. For this project, it seems to make more sense to go local as that is, according to my understanding, in some sense the very ethos of the fab movement. I had a cool idea for remote chess boards but am a couple of years late, because those have already been producticed and commercialized by, for example, [ChessUp](https://playchessup.com/en-eu) (although I think I could make them nicer looking), which was both cool and a bit of a bummer. Maybe I will make them nicer looking and/or cheaper and compete that way one day.

After discovering this, I lost my appetite for the idea and tried turning to solving some personal problems instead. The only issue is that I currently cannot come up with too many problems I would have - how incredible is it to live in Finland and be in a modestly decent fiscal situation for a student? - so there were no obvious project ideas for this particular scope. I still do have many ideas but many of them were not directly suitable for this course. I kept on wondering about another remotely playable board game but after extensive research, I could not come up with any other the playing experience of which would be significantly improved over just a digital version. I would then have to create a new game myself, which I opened as a background tab in my mind and still keep there. However, here are the results of my further brainstorming within the bounds of the course:

- Luminous remote chess
- Remotely playable board game
- Connected, re-arrangeable statues that mirror each other's shapes. For example, a rigid string that can be folded to a shape, causing the other to take the same shape
- Remote drawing / writing inspired by spanreeds from [The Stormlight Archive](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/the-stormlight-archive-series/)
- 3D printer that scans the item put inside it and then replicates it
- Box that opens only when a task is completed (can be used for locking away one's phone or to keep a reward)
- Physical wave synthesizer that produces sound corresponding to the shape of a string (sine, saw, square etc.)
- Midi controller
- Mood lamp
- Wall clock
- Bright light alarm clock
- Something for a bookcase (physical reading challenge / art?)
- Weasley clock
- Lightsaber laser pointer
- Perpetual motion machine

Most interesting avenues:

- Action at a distance / "Magical items‚Äù
    - Remotely playable board game
    - Kinetic statues
    - Weasley clock
    - Spanreed
    - Lightsaber laser pointer
- Productivity boosters
    - Innovative alarm clock
    - Phone / reward locker
    - Year progress bar
    - Task / mortality visualization
- Midi controller / instrument / player

I ended up leaning toward creating some kind of an alarm clock / light that would wake me up to a simulated sunset. Many exist already, but they are kind of expensive and boring looking so the point here would prehaps be either the design or adding some cool feature that they do not have, at least in lower pricing points. With my non-existent drawing skills, I sketched a few ideas on Samsung Notes with my tablet. They look pretty horrendous due to being incredibly quick, not being drawn in an app made for it and being drawn by me, but perhaps they might still be somewhat representative of the general thought process.

I grew very interested towards the last one "Oval blimp thingy" that I then renamed to "gesture controlled bright alarm lamp", which Rosa suggested should be called the "LED Zeppelin" due to its resemblance to a zeppelin and the resulting pun. It was actually a real shower thought stumbled upon when pondering possible interesting shapes for a sunrise alarm clock. I think I was drawn to it for its elegance, where the oval is the perfect shape for simulating sunrises and sunsets. All electronics would be packed inside of it so that the stands could be changeable and thus a bit more of a design element that can go anywhere from minimalist to elaborate. 

It also provides the perfect range of scaling challenge. Its primary function would be to function as an alarm clock that simulates a sunrise with independently controllable LEDs inside. The alarm would be set in a simple app that communicates with the lamp over Bluetooth to set the times for the alarm (integration with native clock apps is also an interesting potential avenue for exploration). A built-in speaker could also play some noise that increases in volume with the brightness. The secondary functions would be gesture controls, where a whole palm touch would turn it on and off and sliding one's hand over it would increase brightness in one way and reduce it in the other. The tertiary function would be to control the colors from the app in some unified way and make the brightness control dynamic such that lower brightness levels are warmer and higher are cooler.

An interesting addition would also be habit tracking, where, for example, a one fingered tap is a positive note, to which the lamp would react by a brief, gentle green blink and catalogue that in the app, where it could possibly be elaborated upon or just left as a positive mark. The ranking is based on which functionalities I would most need but it might be that 1 and 2 change places too. Achieving all of these would be perfect but there are also further expansion possibilites such as adding more long-distance proximity detection, adding mood lamp and connectivity functionality between other similar lamps, so that if two are connected and one is being touched, that is signaled to the other too. Also orientation detection for optimizing the light patterns based for each stand could be interesting. The possibilities are almost endless and the end product might be something like an expressive companion that would be similar to, for example, Alexa, but with light instead of voice.

## Documentation

I utilized the electronics design week and output devices week for getting acquinted with the [XIAO SAMD21](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/) and [XIAO ESP32C3](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_ESP32C3_Getting_Started/) boards that I could use for gesture input and wireless communication respectively, although the latter capabilities I have not yet further explored. Below are the two boards I designed and used for testing the input and output capabilities during the electronics design, input and output weeks:

![XIAO SAMD21 QTouch controller board](xiao-samd21-qtouch-board.webp)

The XIAO SAMD21 QTouch controller board was designed and manufactured during the [electronics design week]({{< relref "post/week-8/index.md" >}}), documentation for which can be found [here]({{< relref "post/week-8/index.md" >}}). It was then programmed to sense changes in capacitance, i.e. touch, through various materials of varying thickness during the [input devices week]({{< relref "post/week-10/index.md" >}}), documentation for which can be found [here]({{< relref "post/week-10/index.md" >}}). It can reliably detect touch through over 4mm of transparent acrylic while still (barely) resolving the capacitance changes through 11mm of paper, i.e. 200 pages of a text book. It was also programmed to distinguish between tap and slide/swipe gestures, which control two state variables `power_on` and `brightness_level` respectively, such that the charlieplexed LED corresponding to the pad last touched during the swipe is on if the power is on. Tapping turns the LEDs corresponding to the latest state either on or off depending on its current state.

![XIAO ESP32C3 output board](output-board.webp)

For the [XIAO ESP32C3-powered output board]({{< relref "post/week-9/index.md" >}}) above, whose documentation can be found [here]({{< relref "post/week-9/index.md" >}}), I tested four different ways of controlling WS2812B strips but only two of them lit up the LEDs in the first place. Furthermore, none of them displayed the right colors, likely because the strip was not what I thought it was. This issue was indeed solved for the final board by using a newly ordered LED strip with the exact same code.

The output board was really a major failure on its own. I could not make it work with 5V power input directly nor by using MOSFETs to try to step up the logic voltage and we had no level shifters in the lab. The only experiments that did power on the LEDs were directly through 3.3V and by using a voltage divider to reduce the voltage from 5V to around 4.5V so that it was well within the spec but could also be reliably controlled with 3.3V logic. However, this would likely not have endured higher currents necessary for running over a hundred NeoPixels at near full brightness. The board also has audio output but it was miswired such that the 3.5mm jack ground connection and right channel were the wrong way around. However, many important lessons were learned and incorporated to the final board design, which then worked mostly as expected. 

### Circuit board

#### Design

The final circuit board is a sort of combination but perhaps even more so a spiritual successor to the [input](({{< relref "post/week-8/index.md" >}})) and [output](({{< relref "post/week-9/index.md" >}})) boards. It became a roughly 96mm x 64mm board with power delivery, inter-board communication, audio output and four outputs for NeoPixel led strips all on a single board. It can be powered on with any 5V 5.5mm plug and supports up to 9 amps of total current for the LED strips. It also features a switch between the power circuit to the microcontrollers so that they can be powered on with the same power input when the project is ready but could also be programmed independently without having to worry about accidentally frying one's computer. Below are its schematic and PCB layout.

![Final circuit board schematic](final-board-schematic.webp)
![Final circuit board PCB layout](final-board-pcb-layout.webp)

The schematic is roughly divided into four functions. Power delivery in the top left corner, gesture detection in the middle left side, light output in the middle right side and audio output on the bottom, which is identical to the [output board]({{< relref "post/week-9/index.md" >}}), except for the two switches that can be used to switch which of the 3.5mm audio jack pin is ground and which is the other audio channel. The reason for this was that upon further research, it seemed like the original audio output design should have been correct, yet it did not work with my speaker - which I suspected has been miswired as a result. Since it was the only plug-and-play ready speaker I had, I needed to be able to plug it in for testing without losing support for correctly wired speakers.

Most notably, the final board has two XIAO microcontroller boards in similar functions as in the previous boards. The [XIAO SAMD21](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/), also known as the Seeeduino XIAO, essentially acts as a 7-channel capacitive touch sensor that also implements gesture detection logic thanks to its QTouch pins, while the [XIAO ESP32C3](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_ESP32C3_Getting_Started/) acts as the main brain of the board handling all heavier logic, output and wireless networking due to its superior 400KB SRAM and 4MB onboard Flash memory and WiFi and Bluetooth 5 connectivity. These are then wired so that they share the power input and ground and are connected SDA to SDA and SCL to SCL to enable I2C communication with the XIAO ESP32C3 as the master, reading changes to the lamp's state as a result of the gestures processed by the SAMD21.

The majority of the board real estate is used for driving the NeoPixel LED strips, which has been done by attempting to follow all of the [best practices](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/best-practices) detailed in the [Adafruit NeoPixel √úberguide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide). These include a 220¬µF capacitor (highest capacitance in a reasonably sized package available at the lab) connected from the positive terminal to the power supply and the negative terminal connected to ground, a 3mm wide power trace capable of delivering currents [up to 9 amps](https://www.multi-circuit-boards.eu/en/pcb-design-aid/surface/conductor-ampacity.html) to [power on up to 150 fully white NeoPixels at full brightness with 60mA each](https://www.temposlighting.com/guides/power-any-ws2812b-setup), 499 Ohm resistors between each XIAO pin and the first NeoPixel of each strip with the distance between all of these minimized while passing through a [TXB0104DR 4-Bit Bidirectional Voltage-Level Translator](https://www.digikey.fi/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/txb0104dr/1629101) to shift the input voltage level from 3.3V to 5V.

The level shifting had been my most major headache during the [output devices week]({{< relref "post/week-9/index.md" >}}) as the NeoPixels powered with 5V could not be controlled with 3.3V logic due to belonging in the [CMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS) logic family. This means that for a bit to be registered as a "1", it must be above 5 * 0.7 = 3.5, which is just above 3.3V. Our lab had no logic level shifters, my attempts at using MOSFETs instead did not work and using a voltage divider would have run the risk of breaking under higher currents, whereas powering on the LEDs with 3.3V would have resulted in running them [out of spec](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf). In response to my struggles, our instructor and the [Aalto FabLab](https://studios.aalto.fi/fablab/) Master [Krisjanis Rijnieks](https://studios.aalto.fi/people/krisjanis-rijnieks/) ordered some of the [TXB0104DR](https://www.digikey.fi/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/txb0104dr/1629101) level shifters, which immediately solved ALL of my problems. The lesson is: if you do not have any, buy some. It is really that much easier.

Integrating them to the board was also delightfully simple and straightforward. According to its [datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/txb0104.pdf), the smaller voltage between 1.2V and 3.6V should be connected to port A and the larger voltage between 1.65V to 5.5V should be connected to port B. According to my reading, the OE pin controlling the output [impedances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance) is optional, whereas ground is obviously mandatory. This leaves eight pins, with four of them on each side corresponding to the "4-Bit" component of the name. The ones on the A side input and output signals with the same voltage as is connected to port A and the ones on the B side do the same but with the higher B voltage. Hence, the 3.3V output of the XIAO is connected to port A along with the XIAO output pins on the same side and the 5V input power trace is connected to port B with the LED input pins on the same side. OE is connected to an otherwise unused XIAO pin and 0 Ohm resistors are used to jump over some traces or alternatively, the shared ground in order to match its thickness more closely with the input power trace.

#### Assembly

It was an effort to figure out which way around the capacitor goes, particularly when I could not find the specific capacitor model anywhere on the internet. Instead, I found [this datasheet](https://api.pim.na.industrial.panasonic.com/file_stream/main/fileversion/19806) for Panasonic capacitors, which indicated the dark streak on the wider side of the base to be the negative polarity marking. I then made the risky assumption of semi-standardized markings and soldered it accordingly, which worked delightfully.

This, however, was the simplest orientation to figure out. The small Schottky diode ensuring one-way power delivery to its microcontrollers
